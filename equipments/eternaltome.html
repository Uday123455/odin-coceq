    <h1>ETERNAL TOME</h1>
    <p>"Grand Warden and all nearby friendly units become immune to damage"</p>

        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Eternal Tome is a piece of Common Hero Equipment for the Grand Warden. It is one of two pieces of Hero Equipment that the Grand Warden starts with, the other being the Life Gem.</li>
            <li>The Eternal Tome appears as a book with golden corners, has a large number of pages which are held by ropes, and at the center is a purple gem with golden outlines. When equipped, it enables the Grand Warden to turn all units around him, including himself, invincible for a brief period of time when he uses his ability. The area of effect is denoted by a circular ring centered around the Warden.</li>
            <li>The Eternal Tome's effect is only applied at the moment the ability is activated. Troops that are spawned inside the area of effect after the ability is activated will not be made invincible.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>STRATEGIES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the Eternal Tome ability near the core so your troops can get through the core, where the most damage usually is. Against a level 5 Giga Tesla or a Giga Inferno, it may be useful to save the ability specifically for the explosion when the Town Hall is destroyed, as it does severe damage.</li>
            <li>Take advantage of the invincibility period by ensuring that invincible units do as much damage as possible during that time. Rage Spells are useful to buff invincible troops and can be used with minimal risk of wasting the spell, since the units are unlikely to get taken out.</li>
            <li>The Eternal Tome's invincibility effect can be used to greatly increase the chance that the Battle Blimps reach their intended drop location for the strategies that use them. However, do note that the Eternal Tome does not stop the Air Sweeper's pushback, so they must be avoided or neutralized with a Freeze Spell.</li>
        </ul>
