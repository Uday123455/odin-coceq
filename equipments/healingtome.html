        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Healing Tome is a piece of Common Hero Equipment for the Grand Warden. It is unlocked when the Blacksmith is upgraded to level 6, which requires Town Hall level 13.</li>
            <li>The Healing Tome allows the Grand Warden to cast a Healing Spell effect in the area surrounding him when he uses his ability. The area of effect is denoted by a circular ring centered around the Warden.</li>
            <li>Unlike a conventional Healing Spell, the area of effect of the Healing Tome follows the Grand Warden such as to be centered on him. Heroes (including the Grand Warden himself) also get healed for the full amount unlike most other sources of healing; Siege Machines cannot be affected.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>STRATEGIES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It can be used in the core of the base, where the Town Hall's weapon is activated/about to go down, as it will mitigate some of the effects of the death bomb and the damage from the core of the base.</li>
            <li>It is best used in Balloon pushes, Miner and Hog Rider Hybrid, and Witch spam, as these medium troops will see a lot of noticeable healing as there can be more of them and have enough health to take full advantage of each pulse.</li>
            <li>If the Healing Tome is combined with the Eternal Tome, healing will be almost completely risk-free as affected units will not be able to take any damage while the Eternal Tome is active. This guarantees that the healing cannot be wasted.</li>
        </ul>
