        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>he Life Gem is a piece of Common Hero Equipment for the Grand Warden. It is one of two pieces of Hero Equipment that the Grand Warden starts with, the other being the Eternal Tome.</li>
            <li>The Life Gem appears as a orangish-yellow gem held by a brown rope with cracks and has amber color at the bottom right. When equipped, the Grand Warden casts a magical aura around him that grants additional hitpoints to units while they stay within his radius, up to a maximum dictated by the level of the Life Gem. The area of effect is denoted by a circular ring centered around the Warden.</li>
            <li>The Life Gem's effects has no effect on the Grand Warden himself, however he does gain increased damage per second and hitpoints by having it equipped.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        <h2>STRATEGIES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>this the best at boosting medium troops' health, since large troops do not benefit much because of the cap, while small troops will not get the maximum health increase. Thus making it a good choice in Hybrid attacks (especially the Super Hog Rider), Lavaloon, GoWiPe, Witch spam, or basically any attack that requires a lot of small or medium troops to make them survive for longer.</li>
            <li>When a troop that does not have full HP enters the range of the aura, the amount of health increase is calculated using the amount of HP that the troop currently has, not based on its maximum HP, and the same caps apply for health increase.</li>
            <li>Since it is not as effective on troops with high hitpoints on a per capacity basis, it is better to use an Apprentice Warden for their health increase and use a different equipment such as the Rage Gem instead as the aura from him does not have a cap.</li>
        </ul>
