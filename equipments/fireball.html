    <h1>FIREBALL</h1>
    <p>"Throws a giant exploding fireball at the closest defense"</p>
    <p><img src="../images/fireball.jpeg" alt="fireball"></p>
    <p>
        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Fireball is the first epic piece of Hero Equipment for the Grand Warden. It was first seen in the Super Dragon Spotlight event in March 2024. Since May 14, 2024, it may appear in the Trader, where it is obtainable for 1,500 Gems.</li>
            <li>The Fireball allows the Grand Warden to throw a giant fireball which deals huge splash damage. It targets the closest defense available (irrespective of its distance to it). If there are no defenses to target, the Fireball will go for the closest target it can find; this target can either be grounded or aerial.</li>
            <li>In addition to the ability, the Fireball grants additional damage per second to the Grand Warden.
</li>

        </ul>
    </p>

        <h2>STRATEGIES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the Grand Warden's ability when confronted with grouped defenses. The area damage he outputs will be able to wipe multiple defenses or troops out at once. It is especially useful when combined with the Rage Gem, as his damage per second will be increased significantly. This damage per second increase can greatly speeds up Warden Walks.</li>
            <li>The Fireball ability can be paired with an Earthquake Spell to easily destroy buildings with a high amount of hitpoints, as even the Town Hall can be destroyed with a maxed earthquake spell, a maxed fireball, and three shots from a maxed warden.</li>
            <li>It also pairs well with the Rage Gem, thanks to the added damage boosts from the Grand Warden, and the surrounding troops funneling to the inside of the base, as well as the Fireball itself destroying key defenses so that the troops do not pull themselves to other defenses for correct funneling. This Equipment combo will help your Warden Walk be more successful, when paired with Healers or Druids, not to say that the Rage Gem can actually increase the damage of the Fireball ability, and can help you win some key interactions against defenses.</li>
        </ul>
